# Algorithmic Trading Project

## Overview
This project implements an algorithmic trading strategy using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The goal is to develop a trading system that can autonomously make buy and sell decisions in financial markets based on historical data and learned patterns.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare financial data for model training.
- **Reinforcement Learning Models**: A2C (Advantage Actor Critic), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), and DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) models are trained using historical data to learn trading strategies.
- **Model Validation**: Trained models are validated using separate validation data to assess their performance and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- **Trading Execution**: The best-performing model is selected based on validation results and used to execute trades in live trading environments.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The project tracks and evaluates the performance of the trading strategy, including metrics such as Sharpe ratio and portfolio value.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Stable Baselines (RL library)
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare historical financial data in CSV format. Ensure the data includes necessary features such as price, volume, and timestamps.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the provided preprocessing functions to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, scaling features, and generating additional features if needed.
3. **Model Training**: Train reinforcement learning models (A2C, PPO, DDPG) using the preprocessed data. Tune hyperparameters as necessary to optimize model performance.
4. **Model Validation**: Validate trained models using separate validation data to evaluate their performance and select the best-performing model for trading.
5. **Trading Execution**: Use the selected model to execute trades in live or simulated trading environments. Monitor the performance of the trading strategy and adjust as necessary.
